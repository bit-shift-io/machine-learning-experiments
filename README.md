QMaze
===========
The first taken from a tutorial

It works, but simply memorizes the map, so doesn't work on any map.

QMaze2
===========
My first attempt to modify QMaze to work with multiple maps. A failure.

============
My first succesful attempt to work with multiple maps. Still not sure yet if it is just memorizing multiple maps.

LSTMTutorial
============
An attempt to learn to use LSTM - long-term-short-term memory
