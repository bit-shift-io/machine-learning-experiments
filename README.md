 
Machine Learning Experiments

QMaze
===========
The first taken from a tutorial

It works, but simply memorizes the map, so doesn't work on any map.

QMaze2
===========
My first attempt to modify QMaze to work with multiple maps. A failure.

PathFinder
============
My first succesful attempt to work with multiple maps. Still not sure yet if it is just memorizing multiple maps.

LSTMTutorial
============
An attempt to learn to use LSTM - long-term-short-term memory

book-recommender
================
Just learning how to use ML to create a book recommendation system


TODO: I realised that the possible problem with my QMaze was that the inputs were absolute, not relative. I need to give the AI the pixels around where they are located in concentric circles. This might also work to give them a history of past steps.
