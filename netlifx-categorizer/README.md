This experiment is to try to get some movies or dataset to self categorise.

My initial idea is to feed all movie id's in then have a seperate slot to put in 
a movie and its fields (tags, authors, etc..) and train it to match with the movie id.

This way when a new movie is released or an unknown movie is feed in, it tries to get
the closest movie id's it knows about. i.e. is recommends similar movies - that have similar tags, authors etc..)
